Some things will never change. What you know and who you know will always be important assets. How many event invites have you discarded into your Trash without even reading through it? Do you ever attend events organized by the Meetup groups that you were so eager to join?

A short email from a classmate <a href="https://twitter.com/FlatironSchool"> @Flatironschool </a> brought me tonight to a neat little community-centered coworking space in Chinatown (<a href="http://www.projective.co/"> Projective Space</a>) to hear an interview of Dennis Crowley, who as I found AFTER purchasing a ticket was a pretty awesome fella.

Dennis Crowley is a founder and active CEO of FourSquare, a popular phone app that lets you "check in" at venue you currently bless with your presence. The broject started waaaay back in the year of 2000 under a name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgeball_(service)">"Dodgeball"</a>. Back in those dark ages of mobile technology, Dodgeball used messaging technology to share names and location. The goal was to help friends meetup without extensive planning. It was "bought" by Google in 2005, and shut down after four years. 

Dennis spoke extensively about his years at Google. Being fresh out of college, where he was "saving pennies to buy a slice of pizza", Google was what seemed like god-sent. He and his friend Alex were offered an office space, medical insurance and "all the free food and M&Ms" which, judging by the number of times he mentioned it (at least 4, then I stopped keeping track), it was a pretty big deal. However, Google wasn't a good environment at that time for Dodgeball and when in 2009 Dennis heard second-hand that the company was retiring Dodgeball, he decided to rebuild an application. His obsession with an idea of bulding "the best local search tool" kept him going. Technology helped too. Apple launched iPhone 3GS in 2009. Android released its Eclair in October of that same year. Facebook was ranked as the most used social networking service by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compete.com"> Complete.com</a>. The market had been catching up. Now, all Dennis had to do was to sell his idea.

Dennis had to learn the hard way how to convince investors in the potential value of the product. He admitted that his early presentations lacked clarity on where the business was, and how he planned to take it forward. Now, he has a solid 150 pages slide deck (??!!?? yes, it works ??!!??). Dennis grew into a role of a CEO of his company, and is a strong believer that people should be allowed an opportunity and an environment to realize their hidden potential. 

As many Internet start-ups, Foursquare did not have a money-making schema  in their business plan. The company listened and responded to the community. Dennis shared a story of how he received a picture of a flyer that one business was giving out that had foursquare logo on it and promised a discount to all those who check-ined. The owner cautiously asked Dennis if it was ok with him that the logo was used. "Everyone talks to everyone"

Lots of thoughts and feelings were shared about technology and tech communities. Young and bold New York community is supported by the city and businesses and greatly benefit from a wide exposure to various medium of artistic expression. Developers are yet to learn the fear of making mistakes, which prompted lots of great ideas to take root. MIT grads now consider NYC as well as established technological locations in Sylicon Valley. 

Dennis did not lack enthusiasm talking about his business. Though he did a pretty good job at staying on track with the questions, several times his finale was "...hmm Forgot what the question was ..." I don't think there was a person in the room not sharing his nearly extatic exitement about the passion that everyone shared. 

Dennis believes that he has a good product for those who choose to live in the city. More and more people are choosing to live in cities and will need ways to explore and experience their homes. I have moved to New York less than two weeks ago. I used my facebook check-in first time EVER to tell my friends about tech networking event at the Mayor Bloomberg's mansion that we were kindly invited by our Master Yoda [Avi]('https://twitter.com/aviflombaum') (not too shabby for the first day :P). I geo-tag my instagram pictures and tweets, something that I didn't see much use for in the past. 

It's time for me to wrap-up with this post(slightly over 30 min standard set by Flatiron), push it onto my octopress blog, then share it on twitter and facebook and make sure to tag it appropriately, hope that my growing number of followers read and tweet about it (*Adam said that our first ten posts won't be read by anyone. Let's prove him wrong. Google Analytics is on my speed dial now :)*. I'll check-in @Flatironschool first thing in the morning and find a good Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood for lunch. I'll share few Instagram pictures I took during my walk yeasterday, and make sure that my google+ uploads it instantly when I'm back on wi-fi rich soil...

Is there a pattern slowly forming here? 

Technology is a tool. But when it finds itself in the right set of capable hands and curious mind, wonderful things will emerge. I surely plan on exposing myself to as many positive experiences as possible. Hey, there is an app for that.
